# 📘 Valuation of Employee Stock Options in Unlisted Companies (IFRS 2)

This repository contains my **actuarial thesis** on the fair valuation of employee stock options in unlisted companies, in compliance with the **IFRS 2** standard. The thesis explores the impact of illiquidity on valuation and introduces an alternative approach based on **utility indifference pricing**.

## 📌 Abstract
Employee stock options in unlisted companies pose a significant valuation challenge due to the lack of liquidity. Standard models such as **Black-Scholes** fail to account for this illiquidity, leading to theoretical inconsistencies.  
This thesis introduces a **utility-based pricing framework** to estimate an **indifference price**, leveraging **nested Monte Carlo simulations**. Numerical experiments compare this approach with classical valuation methods.
